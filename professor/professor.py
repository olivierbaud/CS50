# Randomly generates ten (10) math problems formatted as X + Y = , wherein each of X and Y is a non-negative integer with  digits.
# No need to support operations other than addition (+).
# Prompts the user to solve each of those problem. If an answer is not correct (or not even a number), the program should output EEE
# and prompt the user again, allowing the user up to three tries in total.
# If the user has still not answered correctly after three tries, the program should output the correct answer.
# The program should ultimately output the userâ€™s score, a number out of 10.
# Structure your program as follows, wherein get_level prompts (and, if need be, re-prompts)
# the user for a level and returns 1, 2, or 3, and generate_integer returns a randomly generated non-negative integer
# with level digits or raises a ValueError if level is not 1, 2, or 3:
